"""1. What is string """

"""A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is a derived data type.
 Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed.
  Many Python methods, such as replace(), join(), or split() modify strings. However, they do not modify the original string.
 They create a copy of a string which they modify and return to the caller."""

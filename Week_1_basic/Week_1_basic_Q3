Q3. List down the rules to define identifiers in python


1.Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _.
Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.

2.An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.

3.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
i.e global = 1

4.We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
i.e a@ = 0

5.An identifier can be of any length.

6.Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense.
 While c = 10 is a valid name, writing count = 10 would make more sense,
 and it would be easier to figure out what it represents when you look at your code after a long gap.

7.Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, like this_is_a_long_variable.
